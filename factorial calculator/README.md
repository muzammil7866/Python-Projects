# Factorial Calculator

This project provides efficient implementations for calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## Features
- **Two Approaches**: 
  - **Iterative**: Uses a loop, efficient for larger numbers.
  - **Recursive**: Uses function self-calling, clean and mathematical.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only non-negative integers are processed.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Prevents crashes from negative inputs or non-integer characters.

## Usage
Run the script using Python:

```bash
python factorial_calculator.py
```

Enter a number when prompted to see both calculation methods in action.
