# Python Projects Portfolio

This repository hosts a variety of Python-based applications, highlighting my work in Artificial Intelligence, logic programming, and general software development.

## 🧠 Key Domains

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Logic
Projects related to the **BS AI** curriculum, focusing on:
* **Search Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, A* (e.g., *8-Puzzle Solver*, *Maze Solver*).
* **Knowledge-Based Agents:** Wumpus World simulation.
* **Logic Programming:** Propositional and First-Order Logic solvers (e.g., *Crime Logic Solver*).

### ⚙️ Automation & Scripting
* Web scrapers and bots.
* File manipulation and data processing scripts.
* Client-requested automation tools.

### 🎓 Coursework
* **Programming for AI:** Foundational Python labs.
* **AI Lab:** Advanced implementation of agents and environments.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
Many AI projects in this repo require specific dependencies (like `aima-python`).
Please check individual project folders for a `requirements.txt` or specific setup scripts (e.g., `setup_aima.py`).

```bash
# Example setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
