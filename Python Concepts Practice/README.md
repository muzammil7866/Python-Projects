# Python Practice Concepts

This repository contains a demonstration of core and advanced Python concepts, refactored from a Jupyter Notebook for better organization and readability.

## Included Concepts

1. **Generators**: Efficiently create iterators using the `yield` keyword to handle large datasets without loading everything into memory.
2. **List Comprehensions**: Elegant one-liners for creating lists with optional filtering.
3. **Functional Programming**:
   - `map()`: Transforming data across an iterable.
   - `filter()`: Extracting data that meets specific criteria.
4. **OOP Principles**:
   - **Public**: Standard attributes.
   - **Protected (`_`)**: Convention-based internal attributes.
   - **Private (`__`)**: Attributes hidden via name mangling to prevent accidental access.
5. **Flexible Arguments (`*args`)**: Handling variable-length positional inputs in functions.
6. **Closures**: Functions that "capture" variables from their enclosing scope.
